GARDNR
=========
Never again struggle to remember your garden plants' watering schedules with Gardnr.

This React application lets you keep track of all the plants in your garden, the last time each one was watered, and their next watering date. The app interacts with the AccuWeather API to provide you with basic local weather data and triggers alerts for any adverse weather events that you may need to act on to protect your plants.

The app simulates a user logged in view and upon opening the app, you will be taken directly to the My Garden page.

This app was developed by Caitlin Croteau, Matias Wengiel, and Raiza De Guzman as a final project for Lighthouse Labs' Web Flex Program.
